As you know, our group has two English lessons a week: on Tuesday and Friday. 
When the teacher comes and opens the door, we come in and sit down. 
Then we open our bags and take our exercise books and Bonk's textbooks.
And soon the lesson begins... 
We usually start it by pronouncing different words and sounds. 
Then we are usually invited to the blackboard by the teacher. 
After that we usually do some exercises from the textbook. 
These exercises teach us to ask questions, or how to make negative sentences and so on. 
Then, using tests in our exercise books, we usually write spelling, two tests and a quiz. 
During the lesson we speak mostly English.
